*CTF*
a lot of questions we could of sorted using Burpsuit, examples
GamingPlatform, use burpsuit to edito the request and response, remove the token then forward
Powerpoint Sharing and Wastebin add php command in file name or meta data, actual content matter depending on type of question, also how they verifiy the file
Optimus PRIME many similar questions are online make use of google and github
CrackMe.exe and other reverse engineering make use of kali linux decompiler

many encription are type AES and XSAW?

*Attack defend*
nmap -A and nmap -Pn

apache, php vulnerabilities
need to change the website banner to score points
each protocol also scores point
ftp, ssh, http, telnet

most people just hacked the website through php, once teams closed the ports of protocols
host also shadow and create random usernames in each team for potential hacking
not much teams exploit the flags on the other teams server

*Hashes*
Use a small word list say 500 password, most common password recently
run it through a hash, when we get the cracked, analyse it and study the patterns
like does all the password have a special character, upper case, lower case etc.
based on that write a regular expression and search the hash

different hashes have different weightings, "decrypt" we should not use brute to approach
its a low level hash we should be able to analyse it or read up a documentation to find some stuff, basically do research

*Extras:*
Should change Root password
Should change user password
Should know the one username and password by hacking-lab
BIO password
Boot from usb
Grub then into recovery mode
Single password mode analyse the flag
